\chapter{Conclusion}

What does it mean?
Successfully regenerate experimental results with computational simulation
The simulation shows functional connection between thalamus and motor cortex in the real animal
What hypotheses were proved or disproved?
We can make computational simulation which resemble the experimental data
The T-Type calcium channel generate bursting behavior of single cell
The neural population are highly synchronized during bursting behavior
The high synchronization level in neural population can transfer information from one layer to another layer
What did I learn?
I can make computational model that can regenerate experimental data and I can use it to predict new properties of neural system
Why does it make a differences?
The simulation predicts functional connection between VL and M1 neuronal layers
The simulation suggest that reverse testing of KO cells to resemble WT can also drive motor command in M1. The finding suggests that the bursting is the important factor for high synchronization level of neural population and it is the key for neural network to transfer data from VL to M1

Add a new, higher level of analysis
Indicate explicitly the significance of the work
This work shows the potential of using computational simulation to regenerate experimental data in silico and employ it to manipulate properties of neuron network that are hard to do in the experiments and use it to predict new hypothesis
