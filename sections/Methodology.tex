The model acts as a template for simulation study that does not limit to only this research, but also any other neural network models.

\section{Generalised Model for Neural Network Simulation}
The goal of making this generalised model is to make a platform that consists of four basic elements of neural network modelling that can be used in simulation study of various neural network systems. A neural network model in a simulation study should be easy to manipulate properties of neural network and can study many properties of a network at the same time. The model network would not be too complex to understand the meaning of each parameter. 
Also, the model neural network should fit with the existing physiology and anatomy of the neural system.
As this generalised model is just a framework for simulation studies, a neural network built from this model should be tuned to the existing parameters in experimental studies of the system of interest. This process is called parameter search.
The modelling for four basic elements in neural network: single cell model, neural population, lateral connection, and interlayer connection are going to be introduced. Then an example methodology for parameter search will be shown.

\subsection{Single Cell Model}

The single cell in this work has been modelled based on the Hodgkin-Huxley(HH) model, the conductance-based single cell model. For HH model, the membrane potential is described using the idea of electrical circuits (Figure~\ref{GenModel_HH}). 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/GenModel_HH}
	\label{fig:GenModel_HH}
	\caption{The Hodgkin-Huxley model employs the idea of electrical circuit}
\end{figure}


The model has been made based on real mechanism of ion channels and we can add any ion channel that we want to study to the model. This work shows example of Hodgkin-Huxley model with additional T-Type calcium channel and input synaptic connections~\cite{hodgkin1952quantitative, wang1991model, paik2009spontaneous}. The extra ion channel, T-type calcium channel in this case, can be set to be activated or inactivated as desired. The differential equations for the model is as the following.

\begin{align*}
C\frac{dv}{dt}=&-g_L(v - V_L) - G_{Na}(v - V_{Na}) - G_K(v - V_K) - XG_{CaT}(v - V_{CaT}) \\
&- g_{\sigma E}(t)(v - V_E) - g_{\sigma I}(t)(v - V_I) - g_{input}(t)(v - V_E)
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
	\text{where,} \hspace{8em} \sigma :& \text{ type of neurons; excitatory(E) or inhibitory(I),}  \\
	g_L :& \text{ leakage conductance,} \\
	g_{\sigma E} \text{ or } g_{\sigma I} :& \text{ synaptic conductance providing excitatory or inhibitory input} \\
	C :& \text{ membrane capacitance,}\\
	G_{Na} :& \text{ Na channel conductance,}\\
	G_{K} :& \text{ K channel conductance,}\\
	G_{CaT} :& \text{ T-type Calcium channel conductance,}\\
	X :& \text{ T-type Calcium controlling factor;}\\
	   &  \text{ X=1 for normal functioning case (WT) }\\
	   &  \text{ X=0 for not functioning case (KO) }\\
\end{align*}

The equations for sodium, potassium, and T-type calcium voltage-gated channel conductances( $G_{Na}$ , $G_{K}$ and $G_{CaT}$ respectively ) is the following
\begin{align*} 
G_{Na}\ =\bar{g}_{Na}m^{3}h ,\: G_{K}\ =\bar{g}_{k}n^{4},\: G_{CaT}&=\bar{g}_{CaT} r^{3}s\\
\end{align*}

Where m, h, n, r, and s are the channel activation variables. 
For sodium and potassium channel,
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} =&\alpha_{x}(v)(1-x) - \beta_{x}(V)x, \hspace{8em}  x\ =\ m,h,n \\
\end{align*}
For T-type calcium channel, the mechanism has three states kinetic process
\begin{align*}
\frac{dr}{dt} =& \alpha_{r}(v)(1-r) - \beta_r(V)r \\
\frac{ds}{dt} =& \alpha_{s}(v)(1-s-d) - \beta_{s}(V)s \\
\frac{d d}{dt} =& \beta_{d}(v)(1-s-d) - \alpha_d(V)d \\
\end{align*}
Where the $\alpha_x$ and $\beta_x$ are rate constants for each type of channel. The form for these rate constants is taken from existing empirical measurements~\cite{hodgkin1952quantitative, carnevale2006neuron, wang1991model}.

For sodium channel, %$Na^{+}$ channel,

\end{align*}

\subsection{Neural Population Modeling}
There are more than one neuron in a neural system. Therefore, we have to model spatial distribution of neural population. In this generalized model, the position of neurons can be set to the system. One of the control factors for neural population is the density of cells in the system of interest. There are many ways to model spatial distribution of neural population. For example, using the real neural distribution from experimental data, distributing the cells' location randomly, and distributing the cells regularly. In this work, the method for determining spatial distribution is from the work of one of the lab members, revise Pairwise Interaction Point Process model, a developmental model for neural spatial distribution as showed in Figure~\ref{fig:rPIPP}.
In this model, the repulsive interaction introduces between any two cells that come close to each other. This repulsive interaction takes an exponential form $F = a e^{-bd}$, for which, $F =$ Repulsive force, $d = $ distance between cells, a and b controlling parameters. The neural population starts with random population, then after many iterations,  the cells become more regularly distributed as showed in the right of Figure~\ref{fig:rPIPP}

\subsection{Lateral Connection Modelling}

\subsubsection{Synaptic Transmission}
Each cell can receive both types of synaptic inputs, excitatory and inhibitory input. Upon the arrival of spike, or spike event, the membrane potential at the postsynaptic cell respond to the input. They are called excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) for excitatory and inhibitory input, respectively. 
The conductance that is responsible for EPSP and IPSP were modelled as the following function,
$G = w*(\exp(\frac{-t}{\tau_2} ) - \exp(\frac{-t}{\tau_1})$
where, w is the weighting factor, $\tau_1$ is the rise time constant, and $\tau_2$ is the decay time~\cite {carnevale2006neuron}.
The value of $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$  are 1 and 3 millisecond(ms) respectively for EPSP, 1 and 7 ms respectively for IPSP. The example shape of this conductance equation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GenModel_synapse}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/GenModel_synapse}
	\caption{The conductance function of EPSP and IPSP.}
	\label{fig:GenModel_synapse}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Lateral Cconnection Rules}
The two types of cells, E and I, lead to four types of possible lateral connection between them; excitatory-excitatory(EE), excitatory-inhibitory(EI), inhibitory-excitatory(IE), and inhibitory-inhibitory(II) as shown in the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:GM_lateral}. The ratio strength of connection among these four types highly affects the dynamics of.

There are two things to consider when making lateral connection in cell population: connection probability and strength of connection. One simple rule to make lateral connection is statistical wiring diagram, that is, connection probability and  strength of connection depend on distance between cells and follow Gaussian distribution~\cite{ringach2004haphazard,mclaughlin2000neuronal}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/GenModel_lateralConnection}
	\caption{The lateral connection. Left: Four types of connection. Right: A simple lateral connection rule.}
	\label{fig:GM_lateral}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interlayer Connection}
Once we have one layer of neural population, we can put these layers together and make connections among them, so called interlayer connections.
Interlayer connections can be distinguished into two types, feedforward connection and feedback connection, depending on the direction of connection. In modelling, the difference is just the question of which layer is source and which layer is target. Similar to the lateral connection, connection probability and connection strength are considered(Figure~\ref{fig:GM_interlayer}). The latter part of this work deals with the types of feedforward connections, please refer to the section for more details on how to make feedforward connections.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/GenModel_interlayers}

	\label{fig:GM_interlayer}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameter Search : Tuning model properties for the desired system to the existing experimental data}

After the model has been made, we have to do parameter search to tune our model with the biological system. The basic steps for doing this parameter search is as followed: 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Set the parameter and criteria for comparing model and the experimental values
 \item Select the range of acceptable parameters.
 \item Record the output of the simulation when varies level  of parameters.
 \item Select parameters that satisfy all criteria.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 As an example, the parameter search for single cell model is explained. First, in this work we select the properties of cells when T-type Calcium channel is active and when we block the ion channel. The criteria are 1) response to hyperpolarized current injection (number of burst spikes) 2) response to depolarised current injection (number of tonic spikes) 3) change in resting potential when cell are hyperpolarized.
Second, select the free parameters, in case of the single cell modelling the possible parameters are the Hodgkin-Huxley parameters. However, there are common acceptable values in most parameters. Therefore we have three parameters; soma size (x=height=diameter) of cylindrical cell, conductance of leakage channel ($G_L$), and reversal potential of leakage channel ($E_L$).
Third, we simulate the model cells with all combinations of all possible values (Figure~\ref(fig:ParamS)). Lastly, overlap the satisfy region in the simulation matrix then pick one set of parameter that satisfy all criteria. With the generosity of professor Kim, Daesoo, our collaborator, we have experimental data for comparison and select the optimal parameters for our single cell model. In this case, the final parameters are the red dot case; soma = 28 $\mu m$, $G_L$ =	0.0004 $mho/cm^2$, and $E_L$ = -65 $mV$.

\section{A simulation study on the modulation of information transfer in feedforward networks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Introduction and Overall Modelling}

After the generalized model for neural network simulation has been introduced in first part, we utilized such model to study the properties of feedforward network. The research question of this work is how the difference in feedforward connection rules generate different information transfer rate when different degrees of input synchronization are given. To investigate this question, a simple feedforward network with two layers of conductance-based model cells has been made under various convergent connection rules and different levels of synchronization in input as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FFmodel}. The hypothesis for this study is feedforward convergent connection rules; Uniform-Uniform, Gaussian-Gaussian, and Uniform-Exponential rules may determine the synchronization dependent response of the network.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Method_FFN}
	\caption{The simple feedforward network with oscillating input and convergent connections. L1:Layer1, L2:Layer2}
	\label{fig:FFmodel}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Oscillating Input and Static Input}
 In this feedforward network, cells in layer 1 are source cells and cells in layer 2 are target cells. Source cells in layer 1 give input to the target cells in layer 2. In this network, there are two kinds of input patterns that source cells send to target cells; static input and oscillating input as described in Figure~\ref{fig:InputFFN}.  The static input has constant frequency at 20 Hz. The oscillating input is defined by sine wave with offset equal to the average firing rate in the static input, 20 Hz. There are two kinds of oscillating inputs; weak oscillation and strong oscillation. In the weak oscillation case, the input oscillates with amplitude 10 Hz, or half of the mean firing rate. In the strong oscillation case, oscillating input has amplitude 20 Hz, or equal to the mean firing rate. Both inputs have 40 Hz oscillation frequency which is in gamma band.  The exact spike pattern for each cell is generated by Poisson spike generator from the expected firing rate.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/Method_InputPattern}
	\caption{Input pattern to the feedforward network. $f_c$ = 20 Hz, $f_{osc}$ = 40 Hz,$A_f = $10 Hz for weak oscillation, and $A_f = 20$ Hz for strong oscillation.}
	\label{fig:InputFFN}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Feedforward Interlayer Connection}
The feedforward interlayer connections in this work were made by three convergent connection rules; Gaussian-Gaussian (GG), Uniform-Uniform (UU), and Uniform-Exponential (UE). As mentioned in the first part of methodology, there are two things to consider when making interlayers connection: probability of connection and connection strength. The three convergent rules in this work are different in the way they make connection probability and connection strength as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ConvergentRule}. First, the Gaussian-Gaussian convergent rule has connection probability and connection strength that follows Gaussian distribution and depend on distances between cells. The GG convergent rule is a conventional method to model lateral connection and interlayer connection in model neural network~\cite{ringach2004haphazard,paik2009spontaneous, paik2010synaptic}. 


The equation for the Gaussian function use in this work is 
\begin{align*}
y_{p} \text{ or } y_{w} =&\text{  }x_{\text{max of }p\text{ or }w}\exp(\frac{d^2}{2 \sigma^2})\\
\text{where,} \hspace{8em} \sigma :& \text{The standard deviation, control the width of the Gaussian curve,}\\
	d:& \text{ distance between cells,} \\
	x_{\text{max}} :& \text{ the maximum value of the gaussian curve;} \\
	y_{p}:& \text{ The probability of connection of any two cells with d separation} \\
	y_{w}:& \text{ The connection strength of any two cells with d separation} \\
\end{align*}

Next, the Uniform-Uniform rules has connection probability and connection strength that follow uniform distribution over limited range. This UU convergent rule is the most basic connection rule. Lastly, the Uniform-Exponential rule has connection probability that follows uniform distribution but the connection strength is randomly picked from negative exponential distribution. The UE rule was inspired by a study reported that the likelihood that two cells in thalamus connect to the same orientation column exponentially related to the distance between them~\cite{jin2011population}.


\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/Method_TypesConvergent}
	\caption{Types of convergent connection rules; GG - connection probability and connection strength follows Gaussian distribution, UU - connection probability and connection strength follows uniform distribution, UE-Uniform connection probability and random connection strength that follows negative exponential distribution }
	\label{fig:ConvergentRule}
\end{figure} 

\paragraph{} The steps of making these interlayer connections for any range of connection(R) and connection strength(W) for each cell in target layer are as followed: 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find the cells that are located within range of connection ( range = 3 R = 3$\sigma$)
 \item Set the connection probability and connection strength in GG model
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Get the probability of connection of all potential cells, from Gaussian distribution with sigma = R, and peak = 0.85(estimate maximum chance of connection is 85\%~\cite{reid1995specificity, mclaughlin2000neuronal})
   The summation of all of these values is defined as "volume of connection probability" or  "pGauss"
   \item Make connections in GG model from the probability of connection 
   \item From these connections, find their respective connection strength from Gaussian distribution (with sigma = R and peak = W)
   The summation of weights for connected cells is called "wGauss"
   
    \end{enumerate}
 \item Set the connections probability for connection in UU and UE
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item From the volume of connection probability or pGauss as defined in 2(a), calculate the probability of connection for uniform distribution
   \item Probability of connection for uniform distribution = pGauss / total number of cells within range 
   \item Make cells connection for UU and UE 
  \end{enumerate}
 \item Set the connection strength in UU model
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item The average connection strength for UU model, W', is  wGauss / total number of connected cells in UU and UE.
\item Set the connection strength to W' in all connected cells

  \end{enumerate}

 \item Set the connection strength in UE model
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Get the average connection strength ( W' in  4.(a) )
   \item Pick weight for each connection by drawing it from the negative exponential distribution that has mean equal to W'. The equation take the following form, $ p(w) = \lambda e^ {\lambda(-w)}$, for which p(w) is the probability of having strength $w$ and $\lambda$ is the desired mean of the distribution($\lambda = W'$ in this case). 
   \item  Because the W values are from a random generator, the summation of W is not always equal to GG and UU, therefore a normalization is needed in order to make summation of weight for each target cell equalized in all convergent rules.

      \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}

Using this modelling method for interlayer connection, the density of convergent connection to a source cell at coordinate (0,0) is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DenseMap}. The density map has been made by summing up connection strengths of source cells that are connected to the target cell at the center of a plot in their relative distance between cells. This map shows the spatial distribution of source cells that are connected to the target cell and, if they connected, the spatial distribution of the connection strength between them. According to the density map, the characteristics of each convergent rule are revealed. First, the UU convergent rule has constant probability of connection and strength of connection. Second, the GG convergent rule has high connection probability and high connection strength when the source cells are located close to target cells. Third, the UE convergent rule has constant connection probability in all cells within ranges, but the strengths of connections are randomly distributed.

\subsection{The convergent connection condition}
\subsubsection{The range of convergent condition}

When making a convergent interlayer connection using the rules described above, the level of convergent connection  depend on two parameters 'R' and 'W' which are range of connection, and strength of connection (Weight),  respectively ~\ref{fig:ConvergentConn}. The range of connection affects how many source cells can make connections to a target cell. The strength determine how strong the connections can be. These two parameters contribute to the total feedforward connection strength, which is defined by the summation of connection strength of all source cells that connected to a target cell in layer 2. The range of R varies from 50 - 100 $\mu m$ with 10 $\mu m$ increment. The resulted average number of cells that connected to one target cell for R = 50,60,70,80,90, and  100 $\mu m$ cases are 7,19,13,17,22, and 27 cells respectively. The range of W are $50*10^{-5} $ to$ 100*10^{-5}$  arbitrary unit(a.u.). This range of W were chose so that the output firing rate do not exceed 40Hz in all cases because we want to make the convergent connection that the output firing rate do not exceed the input firing rate(the maximum instantaneous firing rate is 40Hz as describe previously.)

	\label{fig:ConvergentConn}
\end{figure} 



\subsubsection{The equalized feedforward connection strength for all three convergent types in each convergent condition}
As described in the steps of making convergent connection, we controlled the strength of feedforward connection to be equal in all convergent rules. We can compare their effects on input type this way.  There are 36 convergent connection conditions as described in previous section. The average summation of weighting factor for one target cell can be plot in a 6 by 6 matrix as in the Figure~\ref{fig:ConSumW}.

%First we developed a model neural network that consists of two layers of conductance-based model neurons; the source and the target layer. Then the connection between the two layers are modeled with the statistical wiring rules, where the probability and the strength of connection only depend on the distance between the projection of target neuron on to the source neurons plane. Then we examined the synchronization level in the network while we turn on and off the T-type calcium channel in model neurons in the source layer, which is known to be responsible for generating burst spikes, after a tonic inhibition of membrane potential. Next, we investigate how the variation of synchronization level in source layer contributes differently to the information transfer between the network layers and how the Connection Probability between layers contributes to level and speed of information transfer between them.
